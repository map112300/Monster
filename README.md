# Monster
```
This application simulates a 2D grid-based game involving a player and a monster. The player's objective is to reach a specific goal, while the monster aims to catch the player. The game progresses in turns, where the player makes a move (N, W, S, or E) each turn, followed by the monster moving towards the player.

The game concludes immediately if either the player or the monster reaches their respective targets. If the player reaches the goal, the program prints "Player wins!" If the monster catches the player, it prints "Monster wins!"
